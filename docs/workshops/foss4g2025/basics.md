# Core Concepts

In this section, you'll learn Terra Draw's core concepts and create your first drawing application.

Terra Draw is built around several key concepts that make it powerful and flexible:

## 1. TerraDraw Instance
The main controller that manages all drawing operations and coordinates between different components.

## 2. Modes
Different drawing behaviors (point, line, polygon, etc.). Each mode handles specific user interactions and creates different types of geometric features.

## 3. Adapters
Bridge components between Terra Draw and specific mapping libraries. They handle the library-specific rendering and interaction logic.

## 4. Store
Manages the geographic data and drawing state. The store holds all features and provides methods to query and manipulate them.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the core concepts, let's create your first Terra Draw implementation.
