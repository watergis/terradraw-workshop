# Environment Setup

Let's set up your development environment for the Terra Draw workshop using modern tooling.

## What is Terra Draw?

Terra Draw is a drawing library that provides a unified API for adding drawing functionality to web mapping applications. Unlike library-specific drawing tools, Terra Draw works consistently across different mapping platforms.

### Key Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works with 6+ major mapping libraries
- **Unified API** - Same code structure regardless of the underlying map
- **Extensive drawing modes** - Points, lines, polygons, rectangles, circles, and more
- **Customizable styling** - Full control over appearance and behavior
- **Event-driven architecture** - React to drawing events and user interactions
- **TypeScript support** - Built with TypeScript for better developer experience
